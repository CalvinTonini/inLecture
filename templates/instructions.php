<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>inLecture allows you to see when courses are holding meetings based on building, day and time! This can be great for shopping period, 
or if you're just wondering what's going on in a given building at a given time!</p>
<p>To get started, select a building. Optionally, you can select a day of week, time of day, and whether or not you want to view
courses recently out of lecture or about to begin lecture. By default, inLecture will use the current day, the current time, and not see other lectures.</p>
